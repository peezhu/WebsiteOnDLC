              <h2>Containerization VS Virtualization</h2>
              <p>
                  In this article, you will get to know the concept of Containerization and Virtualization.
                  Containerization is one of the substitutes of full machine virtualization. It employs many isolated
                  services on one platform; on the other hand, Virtualization is the process of designing a version of
                  anything virtual in nature.
              <p>
              </p>
              Let’s go in deep
              <p>
              </p>
              <h4>What is Virtualization?</h4>
              <p>
                  It is a general approach for getting out of in-house hardware assets. In the beginning, this technique
                  was a revelation because it allowed developers to run multiple OS(Operating system) in different VMs
                  (virtuals machines) all running on the same host. This dissolved the need for extra hardware
                  resources.
              <p>
              </p>
              Let’s have a look at some Pros-
              <p>
              </p>
              Multiple OS can run at the same time
              Easy recovery and maintenance in a condition of failure case
              Due to less usage/need for infrastructure total cost of ownership came down.
              <p>
              </p>
              Though Virtualization also has some shortcomings. Running multiple VMs at the same time on Host OS leads
              to performance breakdown/degradation. The reason behind this is because the guest OS runs on the top of
              host OS, which will have its own kernel and dependencies, this takes up a large mass of system resources
              like Hard Disk, Processor and RAM.
              <p>
              </p>
              These are some Cons of Virtualization –
              <p>
              </p>
              Unstable performance because of running multiple VMs
              The efficiency of Hypervisors is not as good as the host OS
              Long boot-up time.
              <p>
              </p>
              Before containers came along, the “virtual machine” was the technology of choice for optimizing server
              capacity. Programmed to emulate the hardware of a physical computer with a complete operating system, VMs
              (and hypervisors) make it possible to run what appear to be multiple computers with multiple different
              operating systems on the hardware of a single physical server.

                  <h6>What are the advantages of virtual machines?</h6>
                  <p>
                      Visually, each virtual machine image looks like a data folder. Each can be moved and copied as
                      easily as you can move and copy other kinds of files. In this way, your team can centralize
                      workloads and run several different operating systems without increasing overhead, a huge
                      advantage over on-premises hardware.

              <h4>What is Containerization?</h4>
              <p>
                  Containerization is a strategy of bringing Virtualization to the OS-level. Though Virtualization is an
                  abstraction to the hardware, containerization brings abstraction of OS. Containerization is more
                  efficient because there is no guest OS to utilize a host’s OS and do not have to share relevant
                  libraries and resources, unlike virtual machines. Containers works on bare-metal systems, cloud
                  instances, and virtual machines, across Linux, Windows, and Mac. Containerization is a lightweight
                  alternative to full machine virtualization that involves encapsulating an application in a container
                  with its OS. Containerization boots up in a fraction of seconds; this is because Container shares host
                  OS and holds only those application which is related to binaries and libraries.
              <p>
              </p>
              <h6>There are noticeable differences between these two terms, which are as follows: </h6>
              <p>
              </p>
              1. The advantage of multiple copies: one of the major points that differentiate these two processes is
              containers’ temporary behavior. Many copies of a container can exist at the same time in a system like
              orchestration. If any containers failed, one can remove that and replace it, and there will be no
              change or impact on service. Older versions can exist at the same time with the new versions. Removal
              and replacement of the new versions can be done easily if any operation gets failed.
              <p>
              </p>
              2. Scaling related workloads: There is a vast difference between the scalability of a containerized
              workload and a virtual workload. The containers contain only those services which are basic in nature
              and which their functions require, but among those services, one can be a web server like Nginx and
              virtualization workload system, like cabernets, having the capability of judging that when there is a
              need of scaling out the number of containers based on the sequence of traffic follows and can copy the
              images of the container on its own and also remove them from the system.
              <p>
              </p>
              3. Foundation for running an application: the Linux containers format is the foundation for
              containerization format. So, containerization can only run the Linux application as it will support
              only the Linux environment.
              <p>
              </p>
              4. Using microservices architecture: Google firstly uses the architecture “microservices” and then by
              Netflix. One can operate these systems without excluding any single application. In the form of
              functions, they perform small workloads that may be contacted through API, and they perform different
              functions. These functions can be seen in traditional applications, although many applications can
              perform the same functions on repeat.
              <p>
              </p>
              Containerization vs Virtualization: Which one is better!
              The assurance of which is better in Containers versus Virtual Machines (VMs) relies upon your
              objective. However, virtualization empowers remaining tasks at hand to keep running in situations that
              are isolated from their basic equipment by a layer of reflection. This reflection enables servers to
              be separated into VMs that can run distinctive working frameworks.
              <p>
              </p>
              Container innovation offers an elective strategy for Virtualization, in which a solitary working
              framework on a host can run a wide range of users from the cloud. One approach to consider Containers
              versus VMs is that while VMs run a few distinctive working frameworks on one process hub, while
              containers offer the chance to virtualize the working framework itself.
              <p>
              </p>
              Conclusion:
              Containerization and Virtualization differ in many ways, but the primary difference is that containers
              provide a way to virtualize an OS to run multiple workloads in a single OS instance. With VMs, the
              hardware is virtualized to run multiple OS instances. The speed, agility, and portability of the
              container make it another tool to streamline software development.
              <p>
              </p>
              The way forward for your organization will depend on everything from the size of your operations and
              workflows to your IT culture and skill sets. And, containerization and virtualization technologies are
              coming together in some interesting new ways that could influence your decision making.
              <p>
              </p>
              Ultimately, virtualization and containerization may both have a place in your IT strategy. Consider your
              ultimate goals, immediate use cases, and team skillset before setting down a specific path. At Burwood
              Group, we recently leveraged containerization to run our own client-facing managed services portal: read

                  <p class="card-text">In the above diagram, as you see, there is one host OS shared by all containers.
                      Containers only contain applications specific to libraries that are isolated from other containers
                      leading to no wastage of resources. This makes the container deployments faster and more
                      reliable.

                  <h6>Containerization or virtualization: What’s the right path for you?</h6>
                  <p>
                      Virtualization enables you to run multiple operating systems on the hardware of a single physical
                      server, while containerization enables you to deploy multiple applications using the same
                      operating system on a single virtual machine or server.
                  <p>
                  </p>
                  Virtual machines are great for supporting applications that require an operating system’s full
                  functionality when you want to deploy multiple applications on a server, or when you have a wide
                  variety of operating systems to manage. Containers are a better choice when your biggest priority
                  is to minimize the number of servers you’re using for multiple applications.
                  <p>
                  </p>
                  Your use case matters too. Containers are an excellent choice for tasks with a much shorter
                  lifecycle. With their fast set up time, they are suitable for tasks that may only take a few
                  hours. Virtual machines have a longer lifecycle than containers, and are best used for longer
                  periods of time.
