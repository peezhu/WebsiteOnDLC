            <p>
                Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to
                separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker,
                you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

                <h5>Operation</h5>
                <p>
                    Docker can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any
                    Linux,
                    Windows, or macOS computer. This enables the application to run in a variety of locations, such as
                    on-premises, in a public cloud, and/or in a private cloud.[35] When running on Linux, Docker uses
                    the
                    resource isolation features of the Linux kernel (such as cgroups and kernel namespaces) and a
                    union-capable file system (such as OverlayFS)[36] to allow containers to run within a single Linux
                    instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.
                <p>
                </p>
                Because Docker containers are lightweight, a single server or virtual machine can run several containers
                simultaneously.[38] A 2018 analysis found that a typical Docker use case involves running eight
                containers per host, and that a quarter of analyzed organizations run 18 or more per host.
                <p>
                </p>
                The Linux kernel's support for namespaces mostly[40] isolates an application's view of the operating
                environment, including process trees, network, user IDs and mounted file systems, while the kernel's
                cgroups provide resource limiting for memory and CPU.[41] Since version 0.9, Docker includes its own
                component (called "libcontainer") to directly use virtualization facilities provided by the Linux
                kernel, in addition to using abstracted virtualization interfaces via libvirt, LXC and
                systemd-nspawn.
                <p>
                </p>
                Docker implements a high-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation

              <h2>CONTAINERIZATION</h2>
              <p>
                  Containerization has become a major trend in software development as an alternative or companion to
                  virtualization. It involves encapsulating or packaging up software code and all its dependencies so
                  that it can run uniformly and consistently on any infrastructure. The technology is quickly maturing,
                  resulting in measurable benefits for developers and operations teams as well as overall software
                  infrastructure.
              <p>
              </p>
              Containerization allows developers to create and deploy applications faster and more securely. With
              traditional methods, code is developed in a specific computing environment which, when transferred to
              a new location, often results in bugs and errors. For example, when a developer transfers code from a
              desktop computer to a virtual machine (VM) or from a Linux to a Windows operating system.
              Containerization eliminates this problem by bundling the application code together with the related
              configuration files, libraries, and dependencies required for it to run. This single package of
              software or “container” is abstracted away from the host operating system, and hence, it stands alone
              and becomes portable—able to run across any platform or cloud, free of issues.
              <p>
              </p>
              The concept of containerization and process isolation is decades old, but the emergence of the open
              source Docker Engine in 2013, an industry standard for containers with simple developer tools and a
              universal packaging approach, accelerated the adoption of this technology. Research firm Gartner
              projects that more than 50% of companies will use container technology by 2020. And results from a
              late 2017 survey (PDF, 457 KB) conducted by IBM suggest that adoption is happening even faster,
              revealing that 59% of adopters improved application quality and reduced defects as a result.
              <p>
              </p>
              Containers are often referred to as “lightweight,” meaning they share the machine’s operating system
              kernel and do not require the overhead of associating an operating system within each application.
              Containers are inherently smaller in capacity than a VM and require less start-up time, allowing far
              more containers to run on the same compute capacity as a single VM. This drives higher server
              efficiencies and, in turn, reduces server and licensing costs.
              <p>
              </p>
              Put simply, containerization allows applications to be “written once and run anywhere.” This
              portability is important in terms of the development process and vendor compatibility. It also offers
              other notable benefits, like fault isolation, ease of management and security, to name a few.

          <div class="col-8">
              <h5> Benefits of containerization</h5>
              <p>
                  Portability between different platforms and clouds—it’s truly write once, run anywhere.
              <p>
              </p>
              Efficiency through using far fewer resources than VMs and delivering higher utilization of compute
              resources—see "Containers vs. VMs: What's the difference?" for a full comparison.
              <p>
              </p>
              Agility that allows developers to integrate with their existing DevOps environment.
              <p>
              </p>
              Higher speed in the delivery of enhancements. Containerizing monolithic applications using
              microservices helps development teams create functionality with its own life cycle and scaling
              policies.
              <p>
              </p>
              Improved security by isolating applications from the host system and from each other.
              <p>
              </p>
              Faster app start-up and easier scaling.
              <p>
              </p>
              Flexibility to work on virtualized infrastructures or on bare metal servers
              <p>
              </p>
              Easier management since install, upgrade, and rollback processes are built into the Kubernetes
              platform.
