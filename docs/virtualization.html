              <h2>VIRTUALIZATION</h2>
              <p>
                  Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer abstracted
                  from the actual hardware. Most commonly, it refers to running multiple operating systems on a computer
                  system simultaneously. To the applications running on top of the virtualized machine, it can appear as
                  if they are on their own dedicated machine, where the operating system, libraries, and other programs
                  are unique to the guest virtualized system and unconnected to the host operating system which sits
                  below it.
              <p>
              </p>
              There are many reasons why people utilize virtualization in computing. To desktop users, the most
              common use is to be able to run applications meant for a different operating system without having to
              switch computers or reboot into a different system. For administrators of servers, virtualization also
              offers the ability to run different operating systems, but perhaps, more importantly, it offers a way
              to segment a large system into many smaller parts, allowing the server to be used more efficiently by
              a number of different users or applications with different needs. It also allows for isolation,
              keeping programs running inside of a virtual machine safe from the processes taking place in another
              virtual machine on the same host.

              <h5>Advantages of Virtualization</h5>
              <p>
                  One of the advantages of server virtualization is hardware costs can be massively reduced. Businesses
                  can virtualize many servers and host them on one physical machine. In many cases, servers in strictly
                  physical environments are only using a small portion of their capacity at any given time. With
                  virtualization, resource allocation and use can be much more dynamic, which can save on costs by
                  reducing the need to purchase more physical hardware. As a side effect, you can also save on energy
                  costs. Running fewer physical machines puts a lower toll on your energy systems, which can reduce the
                  costs you pay each month for electricity. You can also reduce the costs of hiring a building or space
                  to store your servers.
              <p>
              </p>
              Second, server virtualization can lead to much faster server provisioning and deployment. Virtual
              machines can be set up much more quickly and existing machines (and their settings) can be easily
              cloned. This means if you need a new server, with virtual machines you can set one up much quicker
              than if you needed to order and assemble new hardware.
              <p>
              </p>
              With virtual servers, data can easily be replicated and backed up to other machines. This can prove
              critical in a disaster recovery scenario, in which data and backups need to be quickly restored and
              discovered.
              <p>
              </p>
              Finally, when faster provisioning, deployment, replication, and backup are involved, overheads for
              administrators are reduced. This can save time for your admin team and allow them to focus their
              energy elsewhere, leading to greater productivity.

                  <p class="card-text">Overall, virtualizing your servers and other parts of your computing environment
                      is a positive and useful step all businesses should be looking into. It can reduce costs in many
                      different ways, free up time for your IT team, and allow greater productivity and more-effective
                      disaster recovery processes.
